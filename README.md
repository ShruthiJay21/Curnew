A lot of people go to supermarkets and retail stores and shops to idle around and window-shop instead of purchasing any products. The thought of analyzing this kind of behavior was intriguing.   

How does this kind of behavior affect product sales? 

What time periods these people were coming in? 

What could help the owners count the number of customers by cross-referencing the billing data, but how do you count the people who havenâ€™t shopped? 

Object detection and tracking is one of the areas of computer vision that is maturing very rapidly. It allows us to identify and locate objects in an image or video. With this kind of identification and localization, object detection and tracking can be used to count objects in a particular scene and determine and track their precise locations, all while accurately labeling them. 

In this project, we have made use of two of the most popular Python libraries for object detection, OpenCV and Image AI.
